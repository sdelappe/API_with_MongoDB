# API_with_MongoDB

This API is built to interact with a database containing items that might be found in a video game such as swords, potions, armor, etc.

Repositories
=================
* A MongoDB database is present through Docker. The MongoDB client is registered as a singleton in order to only have one instance of the repository.
* An in-memory repository was created initially to visualize the items within the repository. It is still present within the API, but is not called upon in Startup.cs.
